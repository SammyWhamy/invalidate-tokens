### My token was found in your repo!!

If you got a system DM saying your token was found here, it's because I found your bot's token.  
In the tokens.txt file you can see where I found your token, make sure your don't post your new token here again.

> Replit has [secret management](https://blog.replit.com/secrets), make use of it!

#### Note that someone could've used your token to do much worse than simply invalidate it. Keep your token safe!
