## My token was found in your repository!!
If you got a system DM saying your token was found here, it's because I found your bot's token.  
When I find someone's token, I post it in this respotitory. This will cause your bot to go offline, and your token to be reset. This way, the next person that comes across your replit won't be able to abuse your token. You will have to regenerate a new token on your developer dashboard. Please <strong>do not</strong> put your token back in the same place, as this link is now also available on this repository. Use replits [secret management](https://blog.replit.com/secrets) instead.

In the [tokens.md](https://github.com/SammyWhamy/invalidate-tokens/blob/main/tokens.md) file you can see where I found your token, make sure your don't post your new token here again.

> Code on replit is public!  
> Replit has [secret management](https://blog.replit.com/secrets) to keep sensitive information <strong>private</strong>, make use of it!

#### Note that someone could've used your token to do much worse than simply invalidate it. [Keep your token safe!](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#configuring-a-bot:~:text=Bot%20tokens%20are%20used%20to%20authorize%20API%20requests%20and%20carry%20all%20of%20your%20bot%20user%E2%80%99s%20permissions%2C%20making%20them%20highly%20sensitive.%20Make%20sure%20to%20never%20share%20your%20token%20or%20check%20it%20into%20any%20kind%20of%20version%20control.)
