### My token was found in your repo!!

If you got a system DM saying your token was found here, it's because I found your bot's token.  
In the tokens.txt file you can see where I found your token, make sure your don't post your new token here again.

> Replit has [secret management](https://blog.replit.com/secrets), make use of it!

#### Note that someone could've used your token to do much worse than simply invalidate it. [Keep your token safe!](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#configuring-a-bot:~:text=Bot%20tokens%20are%20used%20to%20authorize%20API%20requests%20and%20carry%20all%20of%20your%20bot%20user%E2%80%99s%20permissions%2C%20making%20them%20highly%20sensitive.%20Make%20sure%20to%20never%20share%20your%20token%20or%20check%20it%20into%20any%20kind%20of%20version%20control.)
